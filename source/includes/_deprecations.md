# Deprecation Schedule
Below you can find a list of deprecated API features, as well as the information on when those features will be removed
from the API. Since we follow semantic versioning for the API, only major releases will include breaking changes.

Please note that the removal date marks when the feature MAY be removed from the API. The feature won't be removed
until the next release after the removal date, whenever that may fall.
